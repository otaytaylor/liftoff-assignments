## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project idea is to make an application that will match the user to a few dog breeds that will match the user based on their personality and lifestyle. It will be in a quiz type style with 10-15 questions. At the end of the quiz it will show 3 or 4 dog breeds and the information about those dogs. The user can also decide if they want to create an account to save their results or just use the site as a guest. 

### Features
